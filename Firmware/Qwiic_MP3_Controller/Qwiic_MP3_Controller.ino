  An ATtiny84 receives I2C commands from a master and sends/receives commands over serial to the
  WT2003S MP3 player IC. Play, stop, next, previous, and volume control are all accessible over
  I2C. The ATtiny also checks four trigger pins and plays the appropriate track based on which
  trigger pins are pulled low.

  The interrupt pin is active low, open drain. The int pin will go low when a track has completed and
  will remain low until either a track is played or the status of the Qwiic MP3 is queried.

  Available I2C Commands:
  0x00 : Stop
  0x01 then 0x03 : Play file named F003.mp3 - limited to 255
  0x02 then 0x24 : Play file # 36, by index - limited to 255
  0x03 then 15 : Change volume to 15 (half) - limited to 31
  0x04 : Play next
  0x05 : Play previous
  0x06 then 5 : Change Equalizer Setting to bass - 0-normal, 1-pop, 2-rock, 3-jazz, 4-classical, 5-bass
  0x07 then 15 : Set volume to 15. 0(off) to 31(max)
  0x08 : Get available song count on entire SD card
  0x09 : Get song name : Returns an array of 8 bytes
  0x0A : Get play status : 1=playing, 2=stopped, 3=paused
  0x0B : Get card status : Returns true if card is present and mounted
  0x0C : Get firmware version : 2 bytes, upper ver and lower ver
  0x0D : Clear interrupts
  0xC7 : Change I2C address

  Reading data after any command:
  0x00 = OK
  0x01 = Fail, command error, no execution
  0x02 = No such file
  0x05 = SD error

  There are four trigger pins 1, 2, 3, and 4. Pulling pin 2 low will play
  the track named T002.mp3. Pulling pins 1 and 4 low at the same time will
  play track 5. User must name files T001.mp3 to T010.mp3. These are different
  files from the F004.mp3 files that are played using the 'play file name'
  command over I2C.

  Change long:
  v1.1 - Added clear interrupt command. Created Interrupt State Machine.
